# DEF CON 33: Top Talk Titles

DEF CON 33 just came to a close, and after having the time of my life (again), I wanted to give a shout out to my favorite talk/workshop names across the conference. Keep in mind **I haven't actually watched** most of these, these were just the ones that had the funniest, most elegant, or overall stylistically cool names to me. I highly encourage anyone reading this to take a look at any/all of the content found at the links below:

## My Top 10 (in no particular order)

### 1. [Defense Against The Dark Arcs: Teaching Kids to Create Magic](https://info.defcon.org/content/?id=62209)  
Shout out to Harry Potter. A creator talk from the Badgelife community — not entirely sure what “teaching kids magic” entails here, but I’m assuming soldering irons instead of wands.

---

### 2. [Cash, Drugs, and Guns: Why Your Safes Aren't Safe](https://info.defcon.org/content/?id=60304)  
Cash, drugs, and guns — the perfect lock for your attention. Live demo of vulnerabilities in Liberty Safe’s E-locks. You *know* someone’s bringing a crowbar.

---

### 3. [Magnets, how do they work?](https://info.defcon.org/content/?id=61484)  
[Insane Clown Posse – Miracles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSd_nb3-fHA): *F***ing magnets, how do they work?*  
This time, the question is about magnet locks… and how to hack them.

---

### 4. [Making Dirty Pictures – The Issue with DICOM](https://info.defcon.org/content/?id=60941)  
Not *that* kind of dirty.  
Turns out DICOM, a medical image format, has a flaw in its header structure that can hide malicious payloads. Now you’ll never look at an MRI the same way again.

---

### 5. [ARTIPHISHELL Intelligence](https://info.defcon.org/content/?id=61800)  
Nice, clean pun.  
A fireside chat about fuzzing and patching LLMs with the ARTIPHISHELL tool by Wil Gibbs and Lukas Dresel.

---

### 6. [Mythic, Ghostwriter, Nemesis, and Tying the Room Together: The Dude's Guide to Red Team Operations](https://info.defcon.org/content/?id=61066)  
Reads like the call signs of an elite unit. Turns out it’s about automated red team tools that keep your ops running smooth.

---

### 7. [Take all my money – penetrating ATMs](https://info.defcon.org/content/?id=61620)  
Take all my money… for penetrating— *pause*.  
Real-life ATM security issues, with some great war stories.

---

### 8. [North Korea's Fur Shop: Poaching for Otters, Beavers, Ferrets and Capybaras](https://info.defcon.org/content/?id=60936)  
A fur shop? In cybersecurity?  
Turns out BeaverTail, InvisibleFerret, OtterCookie, and ChaoticCapybara are malware families. I would still buy a ChaoticCapybara plush.

---

### 9. [The Challenge with Designing Challenging Challenges](https://info.defcon.org/content/?id=61809)
A triple “challenge” without feeling forced. Elegant. About DARPA’s AIxCC competition strategy.

---

### 10. [Planting C4: Cross-Compatible External C2 for All Your Implants](https://info.defcon.org/content/?id=60391)  
Top-tier hook. Cross-compatible command and control for implants, with production-grade integrations. Was actually the inspiration for this whole list.
