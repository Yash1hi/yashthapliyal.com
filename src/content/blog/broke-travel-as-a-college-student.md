Something that most of my close friends know about me is: I go places, a lot. My statistic is that since turning 18, I have been on a flight at minimum once a month. However, most of these trips cost me less than $100 total, and I was able to make them happen during the academic year. Here’s a quick guide on how I did what I did, on how you could do it, and if it was worth it.

## The Travel Triangle

There are 3 main concepts that you have to accept tradeoffs for while traveling, which are: cost, comfort, and time. When traveling, I overindex on cost, making heavy sacrifices on comfort and time. On the comfort side, this would mean taking budget airlines, sleeping on couches/in airports, and traveling with only a backpack. Timing looks a little bit different. This not only includes the actual time of your flight, with most of my flights being red-eye’s, but also the date. Travel is a lot cheaper on less traveled dates, which means not near holidays and often not on weekends. If possible, I would skip classes, or schedule my classes in a way to have a free day, in which I would travel. The most egregious example of this was me scheduling no classes on Wednesday, so that I could fly after my classes on Tuesday and arrive back in the morning on Thursday to reach my lectures. I made NYC, Seattle, and LA happen through that. While this isn’t the easiest way to travel, if you truly love just going somewhere it’ll be for you.

## Finding Cheap Flights

So now that you’ve given up on the idea of a luxurious experience, how do you actually find these cheap flights? The main way that I would recommend doing this is through Google Flights or Skiplagged, and consistently checking the flight prices. I would spend countless late nights where I couldn’t sleep on Skiplagged, searching through cheap flights and seeing if anything lined up to my schedule. This is how I convinced a friend of mine to make a round trip with me to Chicago on a Saturday, where each of our flights were less than $40. 

The other way is by finding limited time deals and passes. The best one I have found is the Frontier GoWild! Pass, which you can get for $300 if you pre-buy for the year. Using that, you essentially get access to their standby list, where you can get minimum price flights the day before. One tip for this specifically is that the flight cost resets on the day before at midnight for whichever timezone is the latest, so if you stay up until then, you can book a cheap flight for Tuesday on a Sunday night. Again, timing is bad, and so is consistency, but if you just want to go places this is for you.

## Places to Stay

One thing that people quickly notice is that when traveling, the flight isn’t actually the most expensive part, it’s actually your residency. If you’re my age, I’d highly recommend keeping in touch with your friends from HS who go to college out of state. Not only do you have good friends that will last for a lifetime, you also have a couch/floor to sleep on if you ever want to visit. Generally speaking as well, people love having friends over!

You can actually completely circumvent this issue if you don’t stay in a place overnight. For some reason, people are really afraid of taking day trips to places. But if you can find a red-eye flight that gets you there, and a red-eye out, I would highly recommend doing it. You can see a lot in just 12-14 hours, and also you don’t burn as much dead time traveling if you’re flying during sleeping hours. Speaking of,

## Maximizing Travel Time

I’ve done a lot of cool shit with my life, and I wouldn’t travel as much if I felt like I was burning a ton of time doing it. So here are some skills that I would recommend working on to get better.

**Sleep on planes**. Some people can’t. I’m not some people. This is the most useful skill that I have to date, being able to sleep on planes, and even being able to doze in airports. There are a couple of items I’d recommend you invest in for this, namely a good pair of noise canceling headphones. The Sony XM5’s are my go to, but I’m sure you can find cheaper ones with ok quality. I’d also recommend an eyemask if it helps you. The Manta Mask is what I’ve heard is good, but lowkey I just blindfolded myself with a tshirt.

**Pack light**. The less you carry, the less mental load you’ll have, and also the more free you will be when traveling. I almost never carry more than a backpack with me when traveling, unless it’s for more than a week. Every person is different as to what they need, but minimize heavy clothing, and don’t forget that the places you’re in are still lived in. If you forget toothpaste, don’t sweat it, I’m sure there’s a corner store that you can grab a small tube from. And while you go do that, you’ll meet some locals and learn more about the place you’re in. It’s a win-win.

**Work anywhere**. I’m a bit biased as someone in software, but all I truly need to get work done is a laptop and sometimes internet connection. If you’re a student, download PDF’s of your textbooks onto your phone, carry your homework with you, formulate essays in your head as you walk. When traveling, and generally in life, there are so many moments of downtime that are filled with scrolling or zoning out or stressing. Write on a bus, while waiting for your flight, on a flight, in a coffee shop in a different city, anywhere that you can. It makes a world of a difference if you don’t think of that time as dead, just as moving while getting things done.

Finally, **relax**. If you’re a type A person, I get the need to make sure the trip is perfect, that you hit every activity and landmark and you know the exact routes to get from point A to B. I strongly urge you to relax, slow down, and not think too hard about the details. Go enjoy yourself on the trip, don’t plan too hard and far ahead, and just focus on the important things like making your flight. Not only do you get fun adventures that way, but also the mental overhead you take on for each trip becomes far less, letting you focus on more in your life and make travel a stress point.

## Is it worth it?

Depends.

For me it's hell yes. I’ve met so many people, made so many great memories, and have experienced so much more than I could’ve ever wished to just by getting myself out there. It’s a hobby that sticks with you, and makes you more knowledgeable than much else can. I’ve had my fair share of sleeping on airport floors, taking interviews from cafes, and arriving in a new city on 2 hours of sleep. But any uncomfortable experiences paled in the face of the adrenaline that comes from knowing that there is more in the world, and you’ve just seen some of it.

For anyone that doesn’t travel at all, go do it. Seriously, go book a flight, leave your state, and go see what else is there. Everyone lives in their own bubble of a world, and I urge everyone to broaden their perspectives past that. It doesn’t have to be for very long, or for very far, but I promise it will be worth it, even if you don’t want to do it again.
