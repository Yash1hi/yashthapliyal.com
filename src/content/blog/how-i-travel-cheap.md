Yo! Many of my close friends know this, but I travel a lot. My fun fact is that since I turned 18, I have been on a flight at least once a month. I travel on a relatively tight budget, and I wanted to drop the sauce of exactly how I do so.

# **Tradeoffs**

The main thing I have learned from traveling is that there is a delicate balance between 3 concepts: **Comfortability**, **Timing**, and **Budget**. If you overindex in one, the others will suffer. For instance, if you want a comfortable flight on a nice airline on a Friday evening, it will be incredibly expensive. If you would like a nice airline with in-air service without selling your left kidney, you might have to catch a 6am flight on a Wednesday. While in college, I heavily overindexed on budget, taking 2 am flights on shitty airlines so that I could spend less than $40 each way.

Speaking of budget airlines, Frontier is the goat (not sponsored but I wish). I think a lot of budget airlines get way worse of a rep then they deserve, especially Frontier. If you're looking for a flight to somewhere and back, no bells and whistles, go with the budget airline. On top of this, due to runnning on such tight margins, they cannot afford to delay all the time. I'm sure you'll run into some, but generally a canceled flight from Frontier doesn't happen. I am also biased because their hub is in Denver and I flew from that airport, so I could go almost anywhere with them.
