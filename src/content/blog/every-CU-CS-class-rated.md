# CSCI 1300: Computer Science 1: Starting Computing

- **Difficulty**: N/A
- **Course Organization**: 3/5
- **Relevancy**: 5/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 2/5
- **Overall Rating**: N/A

## Course Notes
Varies by student, more experience = better time in the class. I knew Java going into the class but took it to be safe just because it was in C++. The difference wasn't too crazy, so I had an easier time coding. There's a definite learning curve for coding, so if you've never coded before don't get disheartened for not getting it right away. Simply lock in. I had Professor Naidu when I took, I didn't really like her. The class is a bit outdated and isn't too well organized, so again, just be locked in.

- **Course Organization**: 5/5
- **Relevancy**: 5/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 4/5
- **Overall Rating**: 4.75/5

## Course Notes
Pretty important class for learning about linked lists, binary trees, and hash tables, which are important to understand. Better organized than 1300.

# CSCI 2400: Computer Systems

- **Difficulty**: 4/5
- **Course Organization**: 3/5
- **Relevancy**: 4/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 1/5
- **Overall Rating**: 2.625/5

## Course Notes
First course that you learn the "science" in CS. Lecturers are boring and exams are not based on lectures and assignments are not based on lectures. Assignments are very cool though and teach you well, and concepts carry over to many things.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

Probably the most difficult of the core courses you'll take in CS, and it shows because it's hard for instructors to teach the concepts too. Cool labs and you learn a lot of fundamentals, but definitely need to be locked in.

*Review by Owen Brown*

# CSCI 2820: Linear Algebra with Computer Science Applications

- **Difficulty**: 3/5
- **Course Organization**: 4/5
- **Relevancy**: 4/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 4.5/5
- **Overall Rating**: 4.375/5

## Course Notes
Professor Vernerey is a very kind professor and has very well laid-out notes. Matrix methods are relevant, CS applications are good to know about. Course depends on the TA designing the homeworks, so experience can vary.

*Review by Owen Brown*

Great and applicable course, very fair in assigments and in the content itself. It is just on how much time and how much you can wrap your head around the concepts. The coding side was honestly not too relevant, but still cool to see.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

# CSCI 2824: Discrete Structures

- **Difficulty**: 3/5
- **Course Organization**: 2/5
- **Relevancy**: 3/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 2/5
- **Overall Rating**: 3/5

## Course Notes
In my experience textbook has everything you need, don't need instructor very much. As someone who likes math I didn't struggle but definitely had to put in time for homeworks and exam study. Very helpful to learn LaTeX.

# CSCI 3002: Fundamentals of HCI

- **Difficulty**: 0.5/5
- **Course Organization**: 2/5
- **Relevancy**: 2/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 3/5
- **Overall Rating**: 1.4375/5

## Course Notes
Easiest course you can take at CU Boulder. Concepts are very simple and easy to understand, good course to take if you want 4 core course credits that you can essentially not worry about for a whole semester. Will give you an existential crisis on whether you're using your tuition money to learn effectively because of how easy it is.

# CSCI 3022: Introduction to Data Science with Probability and Statistics

- **Difficulty**: 4/5
- **Course Organization**: 5/5
- **Relevancy**: 5/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 5/5
- **Overall Rating**: 4.375/5

## Course Notes
Very well organized and taught course that changes how you look at everything as a whole. Also very deep and difficult content. It is extremely fair and also a lot of work, but worth it.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

Really well organized and taught course that you will refer back to for a lot of your time at CU. Oscamou is a great professor. Content is difficult and there's a lot of content to cover but the course does a good job of getting to it.

*Review by Owen Brown*

# CSCI 3104: Algorithms

- **Difficulty**: N/A
- **Course Organization**: N/A
- **Relevancy**: 5/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: N/A
- **Overall Rating**: N/A

## Course Notes
This course structure varies so heavily between semesters it is impossible to rate. Some say it was a blow off course while others say it weeds people out. Either way, very, very relevant content that serves as a foundation to most higher level CS courses.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

Super important concepts to learn in this class, but they are also pretty difficult. They change the class structure a lot, so it's tough to say how this class will be in the future. Regardless of how harsh the grading is, it is difficult but also very relevant.

# CSCI 3155: Principles of Programming Languages - SPRING

- **Difficulty**: 2/5
- **Course Organization**: 5/5
- **Relevancy**: 3/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 4/5
- **Overall Rating**: 3.625/5

## Course Notes
I strongly implore you to look at rate my professor before taking this course. The professor makes or breaks how you will do.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

For the spring, the course isn't too difficult, Scala is pretty simple and the code you do isn't very challenging. The hardest part is the exams, prepare to apply your knowledge to a new concept or combination of concepts during the exam instead of in class beforehand.

*Review by Owen Brown*

# CSCI 3155: Principles of Programming Languages - FALL

- **Difficulty**: 5/5
- **Course Organization**: 1/5
- **Relevancy**: 3/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 1/5
- **Overall Rating**: 1.125/5

# CSCI 3202: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

- **Difficulty**: 2/5
- **Course Organization**: 2/5
- **Relevancy**: 3/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 2/5
- **Overall Rating**: 2.375/5

## Course Notes
This course goes over some stuff that at the point you take the class is probably redundant (BFS, DFS, Probability, Pandas). Final project is cool, but not too intensive. Quizzes can sneak up on you, so if you want an A make sure to stay on top of those.

*Review by Owen Brown*

# CSCI 3287: Database Systems

- **Difficulty**: 2/5
- **Course Organization**: 3/5
- **Relevancy**: 3/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 4/5
- **Overall Rating**: 3.125/5

## Course Notes
Essentially just different types of SQL for a whole semester. Not heavy courseload-wise, but working with databases in my opinion is super boring.

*Review by Owen Brown*

# CSCI 3308: Software Development Methods and Tools

- **Difficulty**: 2/5
- **Course Organization**: 1/5
- **Relevancy**: 5/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 1/5
- **Overall Rating**: 2.375/5

## Course Notes
Extremely relevant, you will learn many different tools that are used constantly in the industry, but one of the most poorly organized and taught courses. Numerous mistakes in writeups, irrelevant lectures, and outdated content.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

This class is going to single-handedly do Gods work on your resume. However, its not very well organized so you're essentially learning nothing until the final project when you need to refresh on and use everything (bird learning to fly style). Not a useful class until the final month when you make a fully functional website, which is itself pretty baller.

# CSCI 3403: Introduction to CyberSecurity for a Converged World

- **Difficulty**: 2/5
- **Course Organization**: 5/5
- **Relevancy**: 4/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 5/5
- **Overall Rating**: 4.125/5

## Course Notes
By far the best course to take at CU Boulder. Taught passionately, extremely relevant and constantly updated content, and as difficult if you would like it to be.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

This is a super fun class. The concepts are cool, Alex Curtiss is a great professor, and the labs are a great way to learn all of the content. Definitely recommend checking it out, even if you don't want to go into cybersecurity.

*Review by Owen Brown*

# CSCI 3434: Theory of Computation

- **Difficulty**: N/A
- **Course Organization**: 4/5
- **Relevancy**: 1.5/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: N/A
- **Overall Rating**: N/A

## Course Notes
Very biased on my professor (miss you spencer), but I had an easy and very fun time in this course. Learned a lot, but other semester have said it is extremely difficult. The content is not super relevant to software development unless you go deep down the theoretical rabbit hole.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

# CSCI 3753: Design and Analysis of Operating Systems

- **Difficulty**: 5/5
- **Course Organization**: 3/5
- **Relevancy**: 4/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 3/5
- **Overall Rating**: 2.5/5

## Course Notes
Second hardest course at CU. Extremely difficult exams, hard assigments, and very deep technical content. However, very rewarding, and the concepts teach you to think and understand. I would not take for an easy pass, but it is so worthwhile if you want to learn.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

# CSCI 3832: Natural Language Processing

- **Difficulty**: 3/5
- **Course Organization**: 3/5
- **Relevancy**: 3/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 3/5
- **Overall Rating**: 3.5/5

## Course Notes
When I took this course it was ran by some grad students, so it had some growing pains e.g. bad exam but they made up for it with a generous curve. Content was more difficult but course load wasn't too heavy. Relevant stuff for machine learning, project is cool.

*Review by Owen Brown*

# CSCI 4200: Introduction to Wireless Systems

- **Difficulty**: 2/5
- **Course Organization**: 4/5
- **Relevancy**: 2/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 4/5
- **Overall Rating**: 3.125/5

## Course Notes
Well made course, taught by Mark Lofquist who is very smart. To get a good grade is quite easy, but the concepts are very physics and policy based. Not like most CS courses at all, but very interesting.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

# CSCI 4240: Introduction to Blockchain

- **Difficulty**: 2/5
- **Course Organization**: 4/5
- **Relevancy**: 2/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 4.5/5
- **Overall Rating**: 3.25/5

## Course Notes
Practical course, great lectures that are deeply technical, and practical assignments. Course is not hard at all to get a good grade, but content is learned at your own pace. Blockchain is a debatably relevant topic as a whole, but it is good to know the basics.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

# CSCI 4273: Network Systems

- **Difficulty**: 5/5
- **Course Organization**: 3/5
- **Relevancy**: 3.5/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 3/5
- **Overall Rating**: 2.375/5

## Course Notes
Hardest course at CU. Incredibly difficult to understand topics, labs are damn near impossible, and exams are... bad (40% avg). However, the content is extremely relevant at a low level, and teaches you to think. Truly a successor to OS.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

# CSCI 4308/4318: Software Engineering Project 1/2

- **Difficulty**: N/A
- **Course Organization**: 2/5
- **Relevancy**: 3/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 1.5/5
- **Overall Rating**: N/A

## Course Notes
Technically very practical, as you do build a project for a company. However, the project scopes are narrow, your options are limited, and there isn't much guidance from the prof. Heavily depends on the company you get, but with so much variance and no agency, I do not reccomend (take entreprenurship capstone).

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

# CSCI 4448: Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

- **Difficulty**: 4/5
- **Course Organization**: 4/5
- **Relevancy**: 4.5/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 3/5
- **Overall Rating**: 3.5/5

## Course Notes
Great content, teaches you how to actually code well, and if you ever work in big tech this will be everything. However, the project is hard, and the teaching can be not super relevant to assignments.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

# CSCI 4622: Machine Learning

- **Difficulty**: 3/5
- **Course Organization**: 5/5
- **Relevancy**: 4.5/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 4.5/5
- **Overall Rating**: 4.75/5

## Course Notes
Well made content, well organized, and to a good depth to understand. The course was designed to not be incredibly difficult, but still have the concept very, very deep. Prof David Quigley really cares.

*Review by Yash Thapliyal*

# CSCI 4830: Special Topics in Computer Science: Windows Security

- **Difficulty**: 2/5
- **Course Organization**: 2/5
- **Relevancy**: 2/5
- **Quality of Teaching**: 4/5
- **Overall Rating**: 2.625/5

## Course Notes
Well taught course that isn't too difficult, with practical labs. However very very niche.
